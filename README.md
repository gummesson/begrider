#Begrider
*Begrider* is a simple, fluid twelve column grid system with a 1140px fixed width *(or technically 1139px, if you want to be pixel-precise)*. It works great in *Chrome*, *Firefox* and *Internet Explorer 9*. It works in *Opera* too if you donâ€™t mind that some of the columns are a tiny bit off. The goal behind it was creating something that I could actually use and to make it as simple as possible. I think I did pretty good.

Begrider comes in two different versions: The first one *(begrider-new)* uses attribute selectors to apply properties and values on all of column classes and to remove the gutter from the last column in the row. The second one *(begrider-old)* groups the column classes together to add their shared properties and values while seperating them for their unique width property. The demo uses the new version.
