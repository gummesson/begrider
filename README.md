#Begrider

*Begrider* is a simple, fluid twelve column grid system with a 1140px fixed width (*or technically 1139px, if you want to be pixel-precise*). It works great in *Chrome* and *Firefox* and looks alright in *Internet Explorer 9*. It works in *Opera* too if you donâ€™t mind that some of the columns are a tiny bit off. The goal behind it was creating something that I could actually use and to make it as simple as possible. I think I did pretty good.
